Why I call myself lazynintel?
================================

In short it means : **lazy** and **no intel**ligence

* The word **lazy**

Being *lazy* is an important quality to invent new ways of doing things more easily. (It is so hard to write an html page, why not use (invent) markdown!)

* The word **nintel**

I became attached with the word *nintel* during my explorations in cognitive science at IIIT Allahabad, India. In the philosophy of mind, the idea of intelligence as a distinct property of humans never clicked to me. With subsequent explorations to find the correct interpretation I started developing a belief of my own. It goes as follows:

> If there exists an *intelligence*, it should also exist at atomic and sub-atomic level. Therefore, if there is no *intelligence* at atomic level, there is no intelligence at all.

Since almost every person *believes* atoms to be dumb and without intelligence, I coined the shortform *nintel* meaning **no intelligence** exists if that is the case. And I have been using the word ever since.
